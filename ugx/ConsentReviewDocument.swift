The GNEM-DMP incorporates both a reporting portal and a data entry component. These Terms of Use govern the access to and use of the GNEM-DMP.\nThe GNEM-DMP is for use by physicians and authorized medical personnel (the 'Participating Medical Personnel') and participants ('Participants') who take part in registries, observational studies, or health outcome studies sponsored by Digital Infuzion's customer ('Customer'), as well as members of secondary care teams that provide care for Participants ('Secondary Care Personnel') (collectively, 'Users').\nRegistryNXT! is restricted-access: in accordance with these Terms of Use, only Participating Medical Personnel who are approved by Genzyme, and Secondary Care Personnel and Participants who are invited by Participating Medical Personnel, may register to access and use RegistryNXT!. Registration for and use of RegistryNXT! by Users is entirely voluntary.\nThe primary purpose of the GNEM-DMP is to facilitate, in accordance with the Customer's observational outcomes or other study protocols, Participating Medical Personnel to collect, submit, and view data in connection with these studies. Participating Medical Personnel will have the ability to view pre-defined, real-time reports from this data and to share such individual reports with Secondary Care Personnel and Participants. Each class of User has different rights in relation to the GNEM-DMP:\nParticipating Medical Personnel may enter data on the GNEM-DMP, review and query data stored on the GNEM-DMP, and generate reports from the GNEM-DMP;\nSecondary Care Personnel may review reports relating to Participants, but only if published and shared by Participating Medical Personnel; and Participants may review customized reports generated and shared by Participating Medical Personnel and may view a list of Observational outcomes members who are part of the Participating Medical Personnel's team.\nAccordingly, these Terms of Use are divided into sections applicable to different classes of User."

Note that Secondary Care Personnel and Participants will need a valid e-mail address in order to register, as invitations will be sent from Participating Medical Personnel via e-mail, which will contain a personalized link for the invitee to click on in order to register. Accordingly, Digital Infuzion, the primary technical provider, and its agents, will have access to the e-mail addresses for all Users for the purpose of assistance with passwords and for the sending of system notification updates. Digital Infuzion respects the privacy of all Users, and you should refer to the Digital Infuzion Privacy Policy applicable to the GNEM-DMP to learn more about the collection and use of your personal information.\n\nUser Account, Password and Security.\nAll Users, regardless of role, must register and select a username, password, and a security question. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your ID, password and account, and for taking precautions to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of your ID, password or account information. Furthermore, you should not share your user ID or password, even with other members of your staff or practice (for Participating Medical Personnel and Secondary Care Personnel) or with family members or friends (for all Users). For Participating Medical Personnel and Secondary Care Personnel, each member of your staff or practice will need to be separately registered in the GNEM-DMP and obtain his/her own user ID and password. You are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify Digital Infuzion immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. Digital Infuzion will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your ID, password or account, either with or without your knowledge. You may be held liable for any harm or loss (including legal fees) incurred by Digital Infuzion or another party due to someone else using your ID, password or account. Digital Infuzion and its customer may suspend or terminate your access to the GNEM-DMP if Digital Infuzion believes your account is being used by an unauthorized person or if you have not complied with these Terms of Use or for any other reason in Digital Infuzion's sole discretion. You may not use anyone else's account at any time, without the express permission of the account holder.\n\nE-signatures. \nIn order to become authorized to use the GNEM-DMP, you may be asked to furnish information that constitutes an electronic signature. You accept that your electronic signature is legally binding and equivalent to your written signature."

Please note, in some jurisdictions including potentially your own, observational outcomes identification numbers might constitute personal information under applicable laws. When obtaining such consents, you must comply with any requirements arising under their local data privacy, health or related laws. This includes obtaining the Participant's written consent and providing Participants with suitable informational disclosures concerning the processing of their data in connection with the GNEM-DMP. It is a misuse of the GNEM-DMP and a violation of these Terms of Use to enter information relating to a Participant who has not expressly consented to having their personal data processed in connection with the GNEM-DMP. You are solely responsible for any and all information entered by you regarding Participants, and in no event shall Digital Infuzion be liable for any loss, harm or damage arising from or related to your failure to obtain necessary consents from Participants to have information relating to them entered into or processed in connection with the GNEM-DMP.\n\nResponsibility for Secondary Care Personnel and Participant use of the GNEM-DMP. \nAs a Participating Medical Personnel, you have the ability at your discretion to invite Secondary Care Personnel and your Participants to register in the GNEM-DMP. Secondary Care Personnel and Participants will only have access to customized reports specifically created and designated by you. You are solely responsible for verifying the identity of such invitees and for the disclosure of the Participant data to Secondary Care Personnel and to the Participants themselves, including any liability related to the disclosure of such data to the extent disclosure is not permissible under local law. For system performance, Digital Infuzion and its Customer may monitor access to particular Participant data stored on the GNEM-DMP by user ID and may perform audits on such access.\n\nExclusion of Liability. \nAny information and material entered by Participating Medical Personnel into the GNEM-DMP is done at your own discretion and risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss, temporary or permanent, of data that results from the input of any such information or material or otherwise from using the GNEM-DMP."
